STASHING of files on GIT
***************************

# git status ==> * indicates we are on master branch
# vim exitingfileName ==> inster new code for signout button ==>esc ==> :wq!



# git status ==> changes that are untracked and we donâ€™t want to commit them right now.

So stash them on temporary space:

# git stash   ==> all the untracked changes will be moved to temperory space



# git stash list   ==> will give list of chnages stashed 


# git show stashnumber  ==> give stash number


GET changes back from stash ===> UNSTASHING

# git stash pop stash@{0}   ==> will revert back all untracked file chnages
After unstashing, the files will be dropped from temperory shelves.
